This repository documents my end-to-end product management work for Peak Potential, a fitness platform designed to help young adults build lasting fitness habits through personalized routines, community engagement, and AI-driven insights. My contributions included defining the product vision, building the roadmap, identifying user personas, prioritizing features, and executing a go-to-market strategy rooted in real user needs. I created a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) covering feature functionality, user flows, success metrics, and MVP-to-long-term prioritization.

This project is one of several where I’ve applied core product management principles—customer discovery, competitive analysis, strategic differentiation, milestone planning, and retention strategy design. Across multiple projects, I’ve led teams through ideation, development, and delivery phases while focusing on scalability, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous learning. Peak Potential showcases my ability to manage a product from idea to launch-readiness with a user-first mindset and a strong understanding of business impact.
